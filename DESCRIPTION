Description: Tracks reading and writing within R scripts that are organized into
    a directed acyclic graph. Contains an interactive shiny application adaprApp().
    Uses git2r package, Git and file hashes to track version histories of input
    and output. See package vignette for how to get started. V1.02 adds parallel
    execution of project scripts and function map in vignette. Makes project
    specification argument last in order. V2.0 adds project specific libraries, packrat option, and adaprSheet().
