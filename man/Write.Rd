\item{description}{describes object to write}

\item{write.fcn}{function for writing file of object type}

\value{
File information list

\description{
Write object and capture file information
}
\details{
Main writing function for adapr to use in the body of the program. This is a wrapper function for Write.cap.
Write dependencies of the script are captured with this function. \code{Write} will guess which function to use, but
the use can specify any function that writes an R object to a file.
The \file{.rda} suffix will write so that \code{loadFlex} can load the object within another R script in the
same project.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Within an R script:
source_info <- create_source_file_dir("adaprHome","tree_controller.R")
# Inside R script body:
write.csv(cars,file.path(source_info$results.dir,"test.csv"))
Write(cars,"cars.csv","cars dataframe")
# To examine effect:
showResults()  
}
